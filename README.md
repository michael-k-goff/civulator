# Civulator

Civulator is a simple incremental/clicker game. Collect resources, advancing from stone to advanced resources. The best strategy is to build a mix of power plant and auto harvesters. It should take a couple hours to complete.

#### How it is built

Civulator is built with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The base project is React with Typescript, and it more light weight than create-react-app.
